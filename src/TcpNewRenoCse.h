/**
 * \ingroup congestionOps
 *
 * \brief An implementation of TCP HighSpeed
 *
 * TCP HighSpeed is designed for high-capacity channels or, in general, for
 * TCP connections with large congestion windows.
 * Conceptually, with respect to the standard TCP, HighSpeed makes the
 * cWnd grow faster during the probing phases and accelerates the
 * cWnd recovery from losses.
 * This behavior is executed only when the window grows beyond a
 * certain threshold, which allows TCP Highspeed to be friendly with standard
 * TCP in environments with heavy congestion, without introducing new dangers
 * of congestion collapse.
 * At the core of TCP HighSpeed there are two functions, a(w) and b(w), which respectively
 * specify the cWnd growth addendum and the cWnd reduction factor when
 * given an actual cWnd value w.
 *
 * More information: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2756518
